                <p class="text-muted text-left">A tiger is a wild animal which looks like a big cat. Tiger is a biggest flesh-eating animal in its cat family. It has a strong body and it is equally powerful like a Lion. It is found in different parts of Asia mainly India, Bhutan China, Siberia, Malaysia etc. It is the national animal of India as well as Bangladesh. In ancient times kings used to hunt tigers in the jungle and kept its skin to display the prosperity of their palaces. While hunting, the stripes on the tiger’s body help the tiger to hide from its prey.They are considered as the best hunters of the world. Among all of the species of tiger, “Siberian Tiger” is considered as big and powerful. Generally, tigers have black stripes on their orange skin but there are some tigers which have black stripe on their white skin. </p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.</p>

By saving biologically diverse places, we allow tigers to roam and preserve the many other endangered species that live there. As a large predator, the tiger plays a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems.Reason For Tiger Disappearing
                        Deforestation loss of Habitat ,Forests are being cut down for various purposes like paper, palm, housing, furniture, firewood. Deforestation has been the cause of a truly massive number of species extinction in modern times and historical times. It always lacks the large biodiversity of its previous state. With the disappearance of the original forest, many species go extinct, and many that don’t lose a great deal of their genetic diversity and variation.Tigers skin Consumers demand for tiger body parts poses the largest threat to the tiger. Tigers are being illegally hunted for their skin, bones, teeth, nails, etc. which are highly valuable for medicinal use and remedies. In the past 10 years over 1000 tigers are hunted to meet the consumer demand. Chinese people use tiger skin and other body parts for medicinal use and black magic with the disappearance of the original forest, many species go extinct, and many that don’t lose a great deal of their genetic diversity and variation.</p>

So, the male is a peacock, and the female is a peahen; both are peafowl. The two most-unmistakable types of peafowl are the blue, or Indian, peacock (Pavocristatus), of India and Sri Lanka, and the green, or Javanese, peacock (P. muticus), found from Myanmar (Burma) to Java. The Congo peacock (Afropavocongensis), which occupies the forested inside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was found in 1936 after a hunt that started in 1913 with the finding of a solitary feather.Peacock is one of the most beautiful creatures of the earth, which is feathered. </p>

Smaller forms are usually called doves, larger forms pigeons. An exception is the white domestic pigeon, the symbol known as the “dove of peace.”Pigeons occur worldwide except in the coldest regions and the most remote islands. About 250 species are known; two-thirds of them occur in tropical Southeast Asia, Australia, and the islands of the western Pacific, but the family also has many members in Africa and South America and a few in temperate Eurasia and North America. All members of the family suck liquids, rather than sip and swallow as do other birds, and all pigeon parents feed their young “pigeon’s milk,” the sloughed-off lining of the crop, the production of which is stimulated by the hormone prolactin. The nestling obtains this “milk” by poking its bill down the parent’s throat.</p>
